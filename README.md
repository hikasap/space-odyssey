# Space Odyssey

A procedural space exploration and survival game built with Three.js and Svelte. This is started as a hobby project to experiment with three.js and svelte where I will also try to follow planning and development process as much as possible. Also I will be using AI assistants through out the project to help me with the development process.

## Project Idea

**Space Odyssey** is a space exploration and survival game where players can:
- Explore a procedurally generated universe.
- Interact with planets, moons, and other celestial bodies.
- Manage and upgrade their spacecraft ?
- Survive in the harsh environment of space by managing resources ? 

The game is designed to provide a rich and engaging experience, combining elements of strategy, exploration, and survival.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D graphics and creating the game environment.
- **Svelte**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Vite**: For fast and efficient development and build processes.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for game logic and interactions.

## Running the Project Locally

To run the **Space Odyssey** project locally, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-odyssey.git
   cd space-odyssey
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. **Running the Development Server**

    Start the development server to run the project locally:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the game.

4. **Building for Production**
